Description: WTF is a personal information dashboard for your terminal, developed for those who spend
  most of their day in the command line. It allows you to monitor systems, services, and
  important information that you otherwise might keep browser tabs open for, the kinds of
  things you donâ€™t always need visible, but do check in on every now and then. Keep an eye
  on your OpsGenie schedules, Google Calendar, Git and GitHub repositories, and New Relic
  deployments. See who's away in BambooHR, which Jira tickets are assigned to you, and what
  time it is in Barcelona. It even has weather. And clocks. And emoji.
